# 3. Navigate Rahti Console

Pre-requisites: *Exercise 1, 2*

## Terminal session

Open terminal session to your sleeping pod using the Rahti GUI console.

* What is the user id? (`id -u`)
* What is the group id? (`id -g`)
* Try creating file `/hello` containing string `hello`. Did it work? (`echo hello > /hello`)
   * Try that with `/tmp/hello`
* Kill the process that sleeps. Did the pod disappear?

## Cleanup

* Remove the pod `sleeping-pod` using console GUI
